> What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

A: Trees are data structures that consist of nodes. In a binary tree, a node may point to either a left or right child node, unlike a linked list (where each node can only point to the next node or previous node). 

> What is a heuristic?

A: It's an educated guess that an algorithm makes in order to solve the problem faster. Accuracy is sacrificed, although sometimes there might not even be a perfectly accurate answer. 

> What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

A: 

> What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

A: 

> Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

A: 

> What kind of graph is a binary search tree?
