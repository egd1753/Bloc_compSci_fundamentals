# Short Answers

> 1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode allows us to talk about/express code, without confining it to a particular language. This allows programmers to communicate concepts/solutions, even if they don't write in the same programming language. It also allows programmers to focus on the logic rather than getting distracted over syntax.

> 2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Probably nothing, since it's not real code. 

# Programming Assignment

> 1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A: 

```
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number
END IF
```


> 2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A: 

```
INIT an empty array
FOR each number from 1 to 100
	ADD each number to empty array
END FOR
PRINT empty array
```

> 3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A: 

```
INPUT phonebook array
INPUT query
FOR each entry in the phonebook array
	IF phonebook entry matches query
		RETURN phonebook entry
	ELSE 
		RETURN "Unable to find query"
END FOR
```

> 4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A: 

```
function queryPhonebook(phonebookArr, query) {
	for(let i = 0; i < phonebookArr.length; i++) {
		if(phonebookArr[i] == query) {
			return phonebookArr[i];
        } else return "Unable to find query";
    }
}
```
